## From Rotterdam to Hat Yai: The Origin of Grit
Picture this: a kid from Rotterdam, born in 1986, tinkering with networks and dreaming of systems that never sleep. Wesley Steehouwer wasn’t your average tech geek—he was a martial artist, a diver, a guy who’d rather debug a router than follow a straight path. Fast-forward through a decade-plus of rewiring the digital guts of service providers worldwide, from the gritty data centers of Tele2 to the high-stakes escalations at Nokia Thailand. He’s the guy who turned chaos into code, who saw patterns where others saw problems. But life’s funny—it doesn’t always stick to the script.

By 2020, Wesley had conquered the tech world—15 years of BGP, MPLS, and multi-vendor wizardry under his belt, a trail of successful migrations and happy clients from AT&T to NTT. He’d built a NetDevOps powerhouse and racked up 302 hours of Nokia certifications faster than you can say “automation.” Then, a curveball: a life-altering moment that forced him to hit pause, rebuild his strength, and rethink everything. Out of that crucible came Farang Holdings—a venture born not just from ambition, but from a hard-won clarity about what really matters.

We’re not your typical investment group. We don’t just throw money at ideas and hope they stick. Farang Holdings is a hybrid beast: part tech-obsessed management consultancy, part growth catalyst, with a knack for spotting potential where others see risk. Think McKinsey’s precision meets a pirate’s grit, all wrapped in a mission to empower the south—our service area is Southern Thailand. We’re here for the dreamers, the doers, the folks who’ve got a vision but need a partner to make it real.

Wesley’s story is our DNA. From running coffee shops like [Mama's Specialty](https://mamasspecialty.com)—where he turned floods and logistics nightmares into a lean, thriving operation—to architecting networks that powered global giants, he’s learned one thing: success isn’t about size, it’s about smarts. We bring that ethos to everything we touch. Whether it’s a tech startup needing a scalability playbook, a family business craving a digital edge, or an investor hunting for the next big thing in the south, we’re the crew that gets it done.

Our edge? We’ve been there, done that. We’ve built coffee shops and datacenters from scratch, solved system headaches during Phuket floods, and turned Automation into profit. We mix serious tech chops—like Automation and AI—with the raw, street-smart hustle that only comes from years in the game. Operating out of Southern Thailand (HQ in Hat Yai, branch in Koh Samui), we’re more than consultants or investors—we’re in-the-trenches partners, creating alongside you, ready to back you up when the pressure’s on.

Farang Holdings isn’t about chasing trends or hoarding wealth. It’s about planting roots in the south, growing what’s good, and proving that world-class tech and local heart can coexist. We’re the bridge between ambition and execution, the ones who say “yes” when others shrug. So, if you’re in the south—or dreaming of it—let’s talk. Because we’re not just building a business. We’re building a legacy.

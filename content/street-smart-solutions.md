## Floods, Tech, and Balls of Steel

Southern Thailand isn’t for the faint-hearted—floods, old-school tech, consultants who talk but don’t walk. Screw that. We’re Farang Holdings, and we turn chaos into cash. Based in Hat Yai, we’ve wrestled monsoons and wired datacenters. You’re not alone anymore.

## What We Bring

- **Playbooks That Win**: Survive the south with strategies that don’t suck.
- **Tech That Bites Back**: Python, AI, automation—your edge, coded by us.
- **Partners, Not Preachers**: We build with you, not at you.

Startups with guts. Dreamers with dirt under their nails. If you’ve got a vision, we’ve got the muscle. No suits, no fluff—just results.

## Don’t Just Dream—Do

Got a startup or a hustle? We’ve got your back. Book a call and let’s roll.

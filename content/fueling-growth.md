## Samui Hospitality Group (SHG): The Syndicate That Slaps

We run the show (51%), Orange Capital’s syndicate owns 49%. SHG isn’t your grandma’s hotel fund—it’s a hospitality beast reshaping Samui. No dividends for us, just a 5% cut of the profits monthly. Every baht flows back to Orange until they’re square, then we rinse and repeat. Scalable? Hell yes. Honest? Damn straight.
